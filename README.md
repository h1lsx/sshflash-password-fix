# sshflash
Software to flash leapfrog device firmware over SSH.
This branch uses python3 changes by [@Zelec](https://github.com/Zelec) and [@andymcca](https://github.com/andymcca). The legacy branch (python2) does not include these changes. To run this software on Windows, use [sshflash-win](https://github.com/andymcca/sshflash-win).
